# yelp-camp

This application is a clone of Yelp, but for campsites. Users can login, add campgrounds to the database, and leave reviews on other campgrounds. 

I created this application to get practice creating CRUD functionality using Javascript, Express, Node, and MongoDB.

The images uploaded by users are stored online using cloudinary, the helmet API was used to add security to the application.

This site was pushed live using Heroku and can be seen at the following link: https://radiant-mesa-28311.herokuapp.com/
